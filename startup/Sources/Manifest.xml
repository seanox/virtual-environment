    list of registry keys to be mirrored
    
    Supported are registry key paths as well as registry key values.
    - ROOT_KEY\path\of\key
    - ROOT_KEY\path\of\key:name_of_value
   
    NOTE: The mirroring is always synchronized after the end of the target
    application so that changes are retained for the next start. 
     
    NOTE: HKEY_CURRENT_USER is an alias that refers to the specific user branch
    in HKEY_USERS. Windows synchronizes both root keys in real time. Therefore
    changes, incl. creation, modification and deletion of keys, are only
    required on one of the root keys.

  <!-- 
    List of locations in the file system to be mirrored
    
    Supported are directories as well as files.
    
    RECOMMENDATION: Use environment variables, then the locations are more
    flexible and not tied to a specific user account.
    
    NOTE: During runtime of the target application, symbolic links are used.
    This means that the file system does not have to be permanently
    synchronized, as the symbolic links point to the datastore directory.
