; TODO
; Settings provide custom environment variables for the virtual environment and
; can fill placeholders in the files of the virtual environment. For this
; purpose, an ini file with the same name as the environment in the working
; directory is used. This file is optional and can exist but does not have to.
;
; TODO
; The ini file contains two sections: SETTINGS and FILES.
; Details about the sections are described directly at the sections.
;
; TODO
; Basically, sections, keys and placeholders are case-insensitive.
; The notation of the placeholders: #[name]
; Or use system environment variables: %name% 
;
; TODO
; The values of the placeholders come from the variables of the section
; SETTINGS or from the environment variable. Environment variables can be used
; in two notations %name% and #[name]. In both cases is case-insensitive. The
; difference is that the value with the placeholder notation can change by
; line-by-line processing of the section SETTINGS. The environment variables in
; the system notation %name% remain unchanged.
;
; TODO
; The settings are read when the virtual environment is started. The
; environment variables are enriched with them and the placeholders in the
; files are filled before the startup.cmd is executed. Filling the placeholders
; is executed with every startup and overwrites old values when the value or
; file content changes.   

; TODO
; The section ENVIRONMENT provides keys and values for environment variables and
; the placeholder replacement. The values can also already contain placeholders
; from preceding keys or environment variables. Keys start with a letter or
; underscore, then can be followed by alphanumeric characters, minus,
; underscore and dot, and end alphanumerically or with an underscore. Key and
; values are separated by a space, colon or equal sign. Due to the line-by-line
; processing, keys can be used multiple times.
;
; Following system environment variables are not changeable:
;   VT_PLATFORM_NAME, VT_PLATFORM_HOME, VT_PLATFORM_DISK, VT_PLATFORM_APP,
;   VT_HOMEDRIVE
[ENVIRONMENT]



; The FILESYSTEM section defines paths for directories and files on the host  
; system, for which symlinks (symbolic links) are created when the virtual  
; environment is attached. The source of the symlinks is the storage directory  
; of the virtual environment. The symlinks are removed when the virtual 
; environment is detached. For applications, the symlinks appear as regular  
; directories and files, allowing them to be used without special adjustments.  
; This encapsulates program and user data that must be available on the host  
; system within the virtual environment. If specified target paths already exist  
; on the host system, no symlinks are created to avoid overwriting existing
; files or directories.  

; This section expects and processes absolute paths with drive letters. It is  
; recommended to define paths using system environment variables, as this  
; increases flexibility and reduces dependencies on user accounts. If the target  
; drive does not exist, the corresponding path is skipped, and the process  
; continues without error.

[REGISTRY]

; TODO
; The SETTINGS section is an optional list of files where the placeholders should
; be replaced and so to say, only of a list of values. Placeholders and
; environment variables are also supported. The paths must start with a slash
; or backslash. Drives at the beginning of the path are not supported, because
; the settings always use the drive of the virtual environment. When reading
; the ini file, unsupported paths are ignored.
